Key Features of the Vivante 6.x Driver Series

    - Full support for Khronos OpenGL ES 3.2 API. The new OpenGL ES 3.2 and OpenGL ES Shading Language 3.20 specifications bring AEP, 
      plus additional functionality, into core OpenGL ES. Vivante OpenGL ES 3.2 implementation has passed Khronos OpenGL ES 3.2 Conformance Test. 
      And Vivante GC7000XS* GPU core has been certified by Khronos as an OpenGL ES 3.2 compliant product. 

    - Backward Compatible with 5.x and 4.x Drivers. Existing OpenGL ES 3.x/2.0 applications can run on these drivers without any changes. 

6.2.0P2.x
    - Unified driver for i.MX6X, i.MX7ULP. However current release focused in i.MX7ULP. Full integration testing not performedd so there could be some bugs. 

6.2.0P2.x New features:
    - Unified driver that includes OpenGL ES, Vulkan, and OpenVX.
    - Multi-GPU combined mode and individual mode support. More information in the i.MX Graphics user guide
    - Linux DMA-BUF buffer sharing.
    - Brand new OpenGL 2.1, 4.0 driver implementation which is based on ES3 driver code.
    - Improved vProfiler support to include many new HW counters.
    - Compiler optimizations that improve benchmark/application performance.
    - Resolved Khronos GLES3.x CTS failures in all EGLConfig runs.
    - Fixed a YUV420 buffer allocation issue that caused 4K video OOM on Android N.
    - Fixed several GLES driver memory leak problems that cause random failures in Android CTS.
    - Corrected EGL buffer age calculation to resolve a GooglePlay UI flickering issue.
    - Fixed a MMU exception by limiting the number of sampler prefetch in GPU.
    - Fixed driver code issues reported by static code analysis tools.
    - Add support for GL_LUMINANCE8_ALPHA8_EXT texture in the directTexVIV extension.
    - Fixed Xserver crash issues on Yocto X11 desktop.
    - Clamp 3Dblit rectangle size to surface area to fix a GPU hang in Wayland tests.
    - Set HW type correctly in Wayland server side to fix a memory leak in 2D composition.
